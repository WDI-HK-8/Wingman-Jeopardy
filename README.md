# Wingman-Jeopardy

This is a PvP game, the goal of which is to determine who among the players would be the better wingman (according to traditional Bro Law).

Created by Carson Long during WDI-8, assisted by Fer Martin and Harry Chen

#Instructions
- Click the start button to begin.
- The player with the highlighted name is the one currently playing.
- The numbers within the graph cells represent the number that will be added to or subtracted from your score depending upon your answers, consequently the questions that offer more are also harder.
- Once you click a question option, a question and three answer choices will appear, a timer will also start counting down from 15 seconds.
- Click on your answer of choice, if you do not click on an answer before time runs out you will be judged to have responded incorrectly.
- Each question has three possible answers, one correct, one wrong, and one neutral. Choosing correctly will result in a score increase, choosing wrongly will result in a score decrease, and the neutral answer will cause no change to your score.
- After you have chosen an answer, your choice is judged, scores are updated, and it becomes the next player's turn to choose a question to answer. The game will continue until all of the questions have been answered.

#Design
The languages that I used were: HTML, CSS, and JS. I created the project with Sublime and drew heavily from Bootstrap and JQuery. The images used are all from Google.

I approached the problem initially by drawing out my representation of the website on paper and surveying people to see how they reacted. Once I had a peer-approved idea of what I wanted I coded in the base HTML and focused solely on the JS. Once the base program was up and running I came back to HTML and CSS for styling, changing the JS file as needed. Periodically throughout the project I would ask a peer to look over my site and incorporate changes based on their feedback.

#Installation
- 'git clone' the repo to your computer.
