#Instructions
Click the start button to begin. The player with the highlighted name is the one currently playing, decide who will go first as player 1. The numbers within the graph cells represent the number that will be added to or subtracted from your score depending upon your answers. Once you click a (button within the) cell a question and three answer choices will appear, a timer will also start counting down from 10 seconds at that point. Click on your answer of choice, if you do not click on an answer before time runs out you will be judged to have responded incorrectly. Each question has three possible answers, one correct, one wrong, and one in the middle. Choosing correctly will result in a score increase, choosing wrongly will result in a score decrease, and the other button will cause no change to your score. After you have chosen an answer, the correct answer is revealed, scores are updated, and it becomes the next player's turn to choose a question to answer. The game will continue until all of the questions have been answered.
